excerpt: A GitHub Action to help your GitHub profile *really* stand out.
---

A few years ago I encountered the GitHub profile of someone who created a fake commit history in GitHub in order to write their username in their GitHub contribution graph:

> &lt;imagine a cool picture of it here&gt; <sup>because <sup>i <sup>lost<sup>itðŸ¥º</sup></sup></sup></sup>

Since then, I've always had it in the back of my mind as something I'd like to take a stab at. Primarily for the sake of solving an interesting problem, but also to fuck with recruiters who believe contribution activity strongly correlates programming ability (*said with chip on shoulder as someone required to use a separate GitHub account for work*).

Since taking a burnout-induced leave-of-absence, I've had some time to explore the problem, which has led to the creation of...

## [`tbrockman/github-paint`](https://github.com/tbrockman/github-paint)

which is a GitHub Action which\-\-given a string, a GitHub API token, and any optional parameters\-\-performs the necessary calculations to create the right number of commits on the right dates to render something like the following in your GitHub profile:

Since it's a GitHub Action, you can also configure it to run periodically such that your contribution graph always shows the same text as time goes on.

## how it works

The whole thing is a Python [Typer-CLI](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) that primarily makes calls to [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) and [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), orchestrating the following:

1. First, we create a window where `x = number_of_weeks_in_timeframe` and `y = 7`.
1. Then, we take our (potentially repeated) text, determine its size given the font (and the dimensions of each glyph used), and position it within the window (given specified padding and alignment).
1. Then, we map each pixel in the window to its corresponding date. 
1. Then, retrieving the users existing contribution activity for each date, we determine (given [some secret sauce](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78686095/23271846) on how commit activity correlates to pixel color) how many additional commits we need on that day. 
    * If we actually need *fewer*, we can handle this by adding more commits to *other* days\-\-assuming our target isn't zero commits.
1. Then, after initializing a fresh `git` repository, for each day (in the appropriate order\-\-though this doesn't seem to matter to GitHub), we forge the necessary number of commits on each date (since `git` allows setting arbitrary commit dates).
1. Finally, push the new repository and history (deleting the old one if it exists), and wait a bit for GitHub to render our shiny new contribution graph.

So far, it seems to work pretty well, but it's not *super* well-tested, so if you run into issues feel free to create a pull request: [https://github.com/tbrockman/github-paint](https://github.com/tbrockman/github-paint).

hope you like it!
